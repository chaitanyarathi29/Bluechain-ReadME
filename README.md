# BlueChain - Blue MRV Carbon Tokenization Project

## üìñ Overview

The **Blue MRV Solution** is a government-backed initiative to create a **transparent, auditable, and trust-based carbon credit ecosystem** using blockchain and MRV (Measurement, Reporting, Verification) principles.  

It addresses the challenges of the current carbon credit system ‚Äî opacity, fragmentation, and double-counting ‚Äî by creating a **permissioned blockchain ecosystem** for minting, trading, and retiring carbon credits in token form.

## üåç Problem Statement

- Emissions are significantly higher than restoration efforts.  
- Existing carbon credit systems are **opaque**, **fragmented**, and prone to **double counting**.  
- Lack of trust and transparency slows adoption.  

---

## üí° Proposed Solution

A **"trustless but permissioned"** blockchain ecosystem combining MRV and tokenization:

1. **Generators**  
   NGOs, Panchayats, small-scale organizations, and coastal communities carry out restoration projects (e.g., plantations, mangrove restoration) and upload MRV data using drones, IoT devices, and geotagging.

2. **Verifiers**  
   Independent bodies such as NCCR, BEE, state governments, auditors, or field officers approve restoration claims via **multisig verification** (‚â•2/3rd approval threshold), ensuring trust.

3. **Consumers**  
   Industries and power plants purchase and retire carbon tokens to offset emissions.

4. **Carbon Credit Tokenization**  
   Verified restoration efforts result in **minting of carbon tokens** on the blockchain. These tokens are transferable, tradable, or burnable.

5. **Market Mechanism (Permissioned AMM)**  
   NGOs and communities can pool tokens in a **permissioned automated market maker** (AMM), allowing industries to buy tokens with dynamic price discovery.

6. **Grading System**  
   Industries receive sustainability grades (A‚ÄìD) based on emissions offset performance. Higher grades yield government incentives such as subsidies, tax rebates, tender preferences, and advantages in e-marketplaces.

7. **Registry & Transparency**  
   All data, approvals, and transactions are stored immutably on the blockchain registry, preventing double counting and ensuring full auditability.

## üèó Architecture

The solution is built on a **private, permissioned blockchain** with the following components:

### **Blockchain Layer**
- **Hyperledger Besu**  
  - PoA consensus (IBFT 2.0)  
  - Private, permissioned, EVM-compatible network.

### **Smart Contracts**
- **CarbonToken (ERC-20)** ‚Äî volatile carbon credits minted after verification.  
- **Permissioned AMM Contract** ‚Äî permissioned automated market maker for token trading.  
- **Verification Contract** ‚Äî manages MRV validation and mint/burn logic.  
- **Registry Contract** ‚Äî immutable storage of project and verification metadata.

### **Identity & Access Control**
- CA-based permissioning.  
- Role management via **OpenZeppelin AccessControl**.  
- Wallet integration with **Metamask** or custom wallet applications.

### **Oracles & Off-Chain Data**
- **Node.js / Go-based oracles** ‚Äî connect real-world MRV data to blockchain.  
- **IPFS / Filecoin** ‚Äî store MRV reports and project documents off-chain.  
- On-chain storage of metadata hashes for immutability.  
- **ethers.js / web3.js** for blockchain interaction.

## üìà Flow Summary

1. **Restoration Project Initiation**  
   Generators submit MRV data to the system.

2. **Verification**  
   Verifiers approve restoration projects via multisig verification.

3. **Token Minting**  
   Verification contract mints CarbonTokens to the generator‚Äôs wallet.

4. **Token Trading**  
   Tokens enter the Permissioned AMM for trading with industries.

5. **Offset & Grading**  
   Industries burn tokens for offsets; grading is calculated for incentives.

6. **Transparency**  
   All actions recorded in the Registry Contract for auditability.
